# Use this option very carefully as enabling this would cause
# container(s) to be rebuilt every time this is set to true, 
# default behavior is Build Container during First Run, followed 
# by configurations being refreshed.
# When upgrading the container definition or recovering from DR,
# this option would need to be set as true.
# Also refer rebuild_all_containers variable in the global 
# all vars file that would override this and build all containers.
